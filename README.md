**`QubeUK (IT Professional)`**

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) is an annual Advent calendar of programming puzzles. 
This is the first year that I am participating, and I'm using Python.

As it may be obvious by my code samples, I'm not a professional developer. I do however enjoy problem-solving.
